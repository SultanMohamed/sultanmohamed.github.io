      "question": "Which of the following describes the arrangement of network cabling between devices?",
      "options": ["a. Logical topology", "b. Networking technology", "c. Physical topology", "d. Media access method"],
      "answer": "c. Physical topology",
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "Physical topology is about how network cables and devices are actually placed. Think of it like a map showing how wires are laid out, such as in a star shape where everything connects to a central point."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is an advantage of a star topology? (Choose all that apply.)",
      "options": ["a. Allows faster technologies than a bus does", "b. Requires less cabling than a bus", "c. Centralized monitoring of network traffic", "d. No single point of failure"],
      "answer": ["a. Allows faster technologies than a bus does", "c. Centralized monitoring of network traffic"],
      "type": "multiple",
      "explanation": "Star topology lets us use faster technology like modern Ethernet, and since all connections are through a central hub or switch, it’s easier to monitor the entire network. However, it actually uses more cables and relies on the central hub—if that fails, the network stops."

      "answer": "b. PMP",
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) topology suits this scenario. Imagine a main office acting like a spider at the center of its web, where all branch offices connect directly to it to route their traffic."

      "type": "multiple",
      "explanation": "UTP cables can go up to 100 meters before needing a boost for further distances, and they can pick up electrical noise like from power cables since they aren't shielded."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of fiber-optic cabling? (Choose all that apply.)",
      "options": ["a. Can be used in electrically noisy environments", "b. Requires only a single strand of fiber for network connections", "c. Carries data over longer distances than UTP does", "d. Lower bandwidth capability"],
      "answer": ["a. Can be used in electrically noisy environments", "c. Carries data over longer distances than UTP does"],
      "type": "multiple",
      "explanation": "Fiber-optic cables use light instead of electricity to send data, making them great for noisy areas and allowing data to travel longer distances without weakening."

      "options": ["a. Diffraction", "b. Reflection", "c. Refraction", "d. Scattering"],
      "answer": "d. Scattering",
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "Scattering happens when Wi-Fi signals hit small objects like leaves, causing the signal to split up and go different directions, weakening it."

      "options": ["a. Token passing", "b. CSMA/CD", "c. Token bus", "d. Polling"],
      "answer": "b. CSMA/CD",
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "CSMA/CD is like knocking before entering a room. Devices listen to make sure no one else is using the line before they send their data, reducing collisions."
    },

      "options": ["a. Stations can transmit and receive, but not at the same time.", "b. Collision detection is turned off.", "c. It's possible only with switches.", "d. It allows a physical bus to operate much faster."],
      "answer": ["b. Collision detection is turned off", "c. It's possible only with switches"],
      "type": "multiple",
      "explanation": "Full-duplex means data can flow both ways at once like a two-way street, so there's no risk of collisions, and it works only with switches that handle these direct connections."

      "options": ["a. Scalable", "b. Best-effort delivery system", "c. Guaranteed delivery system", "d. Obsolete technology"],
      "answer": ["a. Scalable", "b. Best-effort delivery system"],
      "type": "multiple",
      "explanation": "Ethernet can grow from small to large networks, making it scalable, and it sends data hoping it arrives (best-effort) but doesn’t check if it has arrived successfully."
