    "question": "What is a public switched telephone network (PSTN) primarily known for?",
    "options": ["a. Wireless communications", "b. Fiber optic core and copper edges", "c. High-speed satellite links", "d. Peer-to-peer networking"],
    "answer": "b. Fiber optic core and copper edges",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The PSTN is a global communication network with a core infrastructure mostly composed of fiber optic cables, which are high-speed and reliable. However, at the edges, it often uses older copper cables (known as the 'local loop' or 'last mile') that connect to homes and businesses. These copper segments are sometimes referred to as POTS (plain old telephone system), which can limit the speed compared to fiber lines. Wireless and satellite communications are separate technologies from PSTN."
