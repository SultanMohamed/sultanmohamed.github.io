    "question": "What is the main purpose of using access points in a wireless network?",
    "options": ["a. To replace Ethernet cables completely", "b. To provide a bridge between wireless devices and a wired network", "c. To increase the number of devices that can connect", "d. To serve as a personal hotspot for mobile devices"],
    "answer": "b. To provide a bridge between wireless devices and a wired network",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Access points are devices that create Wi-Fi networks. They allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network, bridging the gap between wired Ethernet and mobile devices. While access points can increase the number of devices that the network can support, the key role is enabling wireless connectivity within a traditional wired network. They do not replace Ethernet cables entirely but supplement them by making connectivity more versatile and widespread."

    "question": "Which frequency band is more congested but better at penetrating walls?",
    "options": ["a. 2.4 GHz", "b. 5 GHz"],
    "answer": "a. 2.4 GHz",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The 2.4 GHz band is more prone to congestion because it not only supports fewer channels but is also used by various types of wireless technology, including Bluetooth and some home appliances like microwaves. However, it has a longer wavelength than the 5 GHz band, which allows it to better penetrate through walls and obstacles. This makes it a good choice for environments with many walls but can lead to slower speeds due to interference and congestion."

    "question": "What is infrastructure mode in a Wi-Fi network?",
    "options": ["a. Devices connect directly to each other", "b. Devices connect via an access point", "c. Devices do not need any access points", "d. Only one device can connect at a time"],
    "answer": "b. Devices connect via an access point",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Infrastructure mode is the most common method for configuring Wi-Fi networks. In this setup, all wireless devices, or 'stations', connect through an access point (AP). The AP acts as a hub, allowing devices to communicate not just with the AP but also with other devices on the network, whether they are wireless or wired. This setup is different from ad-hoc mode, where devices connect directly without an AP."

    "question": "What technology allows an access point to power over the network cabling?",
    "options": ["a. DSL", "b. PoE", "c. ISDN", "d. LTE"],
    "answer": "b. PoE",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a technology that allows network cables to carry electrical power alongside data. This eliminates the need for a separate power source or additional electrical wiring for the access point, simplifying installation and reducing costs, especially in locations where power outlets are hard to reach. PoE is especially useful in enterprise settings where multiple devices such as access points, cameras, and phones need power."

    "question": "Why is the 5 GHz band less crowded than the 2.4 GHz band?",
    "options": ["a. It supports fewer devices", "b. It has more channels and less non-Wi-Fi interference", "c. It is more powerful", "d. It uses dynamic frequency selection"],
    "answer": "b. It has more channels and less non-Wi-Fi interference",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "The 5 GHz band has a higher number of available channels, which reduces the chance of overlap and interference. Additionally, it experiences less interference from non-Wi-Fi devices, since most appliances like Bluetooth devices and microwaves operate in the 2.4 GHz band. This makes the 5 GHz band suitable for environments where faster speeds and lower latency are needed, though it may not cover as long a distance due to shorter wavelengths."

    "answer": "b. It can support devices on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "A dual-band access point can operate on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. This allows it to cater to older devices that only support 2.4 GHz, while also using the 5 GHz band for newer devices demanding higher speeds and less interference. This flexibility can help balance the load on the network and optimize overall performance, allowing users to benefit from the strengths of each frequency band depending on their distance from the AP and current network conditions."

    "question": "What does 'channel bonding' do in Wi-Fi?",
    "options": ["a. Increases the data rate by using wider channels", "b. Combines multiple networks", "c. Enhances security", "d. Reduces communication range"],
    "answer": "a. Increases the data rate by using wider channels",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Channel bonding is a technique used in Wi-Fi networks to increase data rates by combining two adjacent 20 MHz channels into a single 40 MHz channel. This method provides more bandwidth and can improve throughput, making it beneficial in high-speed applications. However, this approach may also increase interference potential, particularly in the 2.4 GHz band where available channels are limited, making it more suitable for the 5 GHz band."

    "question": "You are setting up a Wi-Fi network and notice interference issues. Which of the following could be a solution? (Choose all that apply)",
    "options": ["a. Use 5 GHz band", "b. Change channel numbers", "c. Use more overlapping channels", "d. Decrease the power of the access point"],
    "answer": ["a. Use 5 GHz band", "b. Change channel numbers"],
    "type": "multiple",
    "explanation": "Switching to the 5 GHz band can alleviate interference because it has more channels and less competition from devices like Bluetooth and microwaves working in the 2.4 GHz band. Changing channel numbers to non-overlapping ones (e.g., channels 1, 6, and 11 for 2.4 GHz) can also help reduce interference from neighboring networks. Increasing the power of the access point might worsen interference by extending signal overlap with other devices."

    "answer": "b. Allows multiple devices to receive data simultaneously",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) enables an access point to communicate with multiple devices at the same time instead of one at a time. This increases network efficiency and throughput, especially in environments with many active users, like offices or homes with numerous smart devices. By reducing the time devices spend waiting for their turn to communicate, overall network performance and user experience are greatly enhanced."

    "answer": "b. Active tags have a longer range",
    "type": "single",
    "explanation": "Active RFID tags have an internal power source, allowing them to have stronger signals and longer ranges, sometimes over 100 meters. In contrast, passive RFID tags have no internal power source and are only powered when in close range of a reader, limiting their range to a few meters. Active tags are suited for tracking moving objects over larger areas, while passive tags are common in applications like item tagging and short-range identification."
